<p>What is design? Most people think that design is about making things look pretty – a decoration. Art. But design is as much an art as it is a science. Cold and calculated process. Sometimes the detriment of pretty. Yet, the design is not allowed to fail. Design is for everyone and no one in particular. Website and mobile app design, as well as design in general, is a complex yet subtle process, it’s more than making things pretty.
Meanwhile, the meaning of design depends on the context and can also mean a variety of other things. Design is the creation of an experience. It’s also the process of the said creation and how well it’s organized. On top of that, design is the result, i.e. the things we see, hear, and feel. The meaning of design is so multifaceted, to the point that you can no longer say if a universal definition is at all possible. You can, however, try to look at the sum of the parts to come up with a more realistic picture. So, Charles Eames said that design is all about purpose. Let’s dive deeper into this idea.</p>
